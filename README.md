# Uber_fare_prediction

In this project I have tried to predict fare price of Uber.
So the price or fare is the target variable and I have taken no. of passengers,date,time etc as dependent variables.
Then I used 2 ml alogorithms to predict the fare which are Linear Regression and Random Forest.
After training and testing the dataset using both the algorithms I observed that the Random Forest model is giving much better accuracy.So I have used the Random Forest model as our final model.
